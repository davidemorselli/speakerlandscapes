@TechIsOverrated_2,Technology has enabled our overconsumption. It can't be the only thing that saves us from it.
@DataWhiz_2,The 97% consensus on human-caused warming is based on thousands of studies. Dismissing it is anti-intellectual.

@FutureIsGreen,The world will be powered by renewables. The only question is how quickly we get there.
@TheDoubter_3,"If the planet is getting warmer, why are we seeing record cold snaps in some regions? It's all confusing."
@PolicyExpert_3,We need to embed GHG impact assessments into every piece of governmental legislation and spending.
@TheRealTruth,"The biggest lie is that we have time. We don't. Immediate, drastic cuts are non-negotiable."
@GreenInvestor_7,Betting on lithium and copper mining companies. The demand for batteries is going to be insane.
