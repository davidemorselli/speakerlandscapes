Description: Computing and visualizing speaker landscapes, vector representation of speakers based on their similar semantics, as outlined in Schuld, Durrheim & Mafunda (2024). The procedure transforms raw text into a high-dimensional vector space using Word2Vec and subsequently reduces the data to a 2D "landscape" using UMAP for visual interpretation. For further infomration see: Schuld, M., Durrheim, K., & Mafunda, M. (2024). Speaker landscapes: Machine learning opens a window on the everyday language of opinion. Communication Methods and Measures, 18(4), 315-331.
