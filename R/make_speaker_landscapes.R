#' Load, Process, and Prepare Speaker Landscapes with UMAP
#'
#' This function performs a comprehensive pipeline: loading speaker data from a file
#' path or character vector, aggregating quotes by speaker, filtering speakers based
#' on quote count, retrieving their combined vector embeddings, and applying UMAP
#' for dimensionality reduction. It processes and returns the UMAP coordinates for
#' both the filtered speakers and a set of input tokens for visualization.
#'
#' @param data The input source. Can be either a character string specifying the path to
#'   the file contianing text (The first token is assumed to be the speaker ID, and the rest forms the text.) OR an object of class \code{"speakers_text"} as create with \code{prepare_data()}).
#'
#' @param embedding A pre-trained vector embeddings object (e.g., a matrix of
#'   word2vec embeddings) where \code{rownames} contain the tokens/speakers being mapped.
#' @param tokens_to_plot A data frame or tibble with a column named \code{token}
#'   containing a character vector of tokens (e.g., important words) whose
#'   embeddings should also be reduced and plotted as labels.
#' @param speaker_identifier A character string prefix used to identify the
#'   speaker tokens. This is used in the internal filtering step. Defaults to \code{"speaker"}.
#' @param retain_threshold An integer threshold for the minimum number of
#'   quotes a speaker must have to be included in the final plot. Defaults to \code{5}.
#' @param umap_seed An integer seed for the random number generator used by UMAP
#'   to ensure reproducibility. Defaults to \code{42}.
#' @param n_neighbors An integer specifying the number of nearest neighbors for
#'   the UMAP algorithm. Defaults to \code{40}.
#' @param min_dist A numeric value specifying the minimum distance parameter for
#'   the UMAP algorithm. Defaults to \code{0.01}.
#'
#' @return A \code{list} containing two tibbles:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item \code{speakers}: Data for the filtered speakers, including \code{author},
#'       \code{n_quotes}, and UMAP coordinates (\code{X1}, \code{X2}).
#'     \item \code{words}: Data for the \code{tokens_to_plot}, including \code{words}
#'       (the token) and UMAP coordinates (\code{X1}, \code{X2}).
#'   }
#'
#' @details
#' The function relies on \code{tidyverse}, \code{umap}, and requires the
#' \code{embedding} object to be a matrix compatible with the UMAP input.
#'
#' **Input Flexibility:** If \code{class(data)} is \code{"speakers_text"}, the
#' input is treated as an inline character vector; otherwise, it is treated as a file path.
